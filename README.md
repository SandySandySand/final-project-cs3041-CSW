 Human Computer Interaction Final Prototype Project
 
Using My Prototype:
My prototype is a web-based application hosted on the GitHub Page feature. 
This application is optimized for phone-usage, so if possible, please access the sites page with a smartphone.
 
 If that is not possible:

•	Once you have accessed the page, please right click, and select _Inspect_. 

•	 Then, click the _Toggle Device Toolbar_ in the top right panel to enable the mobile frame.

•	In this selection menu, select _iPhone 6/7/8_ and change the zoom to be _Fit to Window_  

•	You can modify the size of the side panel, as they are not necessary to running this program.
